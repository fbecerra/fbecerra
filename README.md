### Hola mundo ðŸ‘‹

I'm an astrophysicist turned data analyst and data visualization developer. My work is a mix of research, data science, analysis, and visualization and spans a wide range of topics such as sports, science, environment, education, government, and public policy. Some examples of what I've done are this [Voronoi treemap](https://usafacts.org/projects/cpi/inflation-parts) to see how inflation affects Americans of different age, [this interactive tool](https://apps.urban.org/features/education-equity-tool/) to explore students' access to some resources that are beneficial for learning, and [an interactive essay](https://www.fernandobecerra.com/covid-mobility/) on how holidays were the main factor driving people to stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I've also taught data visualization and data analytics classes at Universidad del Desarrollo, Universidad de los Andes, and Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile. Before that, I got a Ph.D. in Astronomy & Astrophysics from Harvard University and a B.Sc. in Astronomy from Univeridad de Chile. If you are interested in working together, feel free to drop me a line at becerrafernando at gmail dot com.
