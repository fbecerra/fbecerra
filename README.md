I am a freelance Data Scientist and Data Visualization developer with a Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics from Harvard University and a M.Sc. in Astronomy from Universidad de Chile. I enjoy exploring and analyzing datasets to find the hidden stories in order to create interactive visualizations that reach a broader audience. My work and my interests span a wide range of topics such as science, politics, and sports. 

In my free time I love being outdoors, be it hiking, climbing, camping, or backpacking. During those trips I always carry my camera to capture the [breathtaking landscapes](https://photo.fernandobecerra.com) you can find in our planet.

If you feel like we could collaborate in a data science, data visualization, or photography project, drop me a line at becerrafernando at gmail dot com.
